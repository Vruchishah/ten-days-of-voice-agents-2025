🟢 DAY 3 CHALLENGE COMPLETED: Health & Wellness Voice Companion

I successfully created a Health & Wellness Voice Companion that:

Conducts Daily Check-ins: Guides the user through a supportive conversation about mood, energy, and daily intentions.
Persists Data: Uses function calling in the Python backend to read and write conversation summaries to a wellness_log.json file.
Uses Context: References past check-in data to personalize the current conversation, ensuring a more grounded and meaningful interaction!

The entire conversation loop from user speech to LLM response to saving data is incredibly fast, thanks to the ultra-low-latency Murf Falcon TTS API.

I’ve recorded the check-in session and the resulting wellness_log.json file.
